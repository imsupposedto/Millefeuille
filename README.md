# Millefeuille_French_DiffSinger_Language_Support
Custom HED and Table for French NNSVS support.

The Millefeuille phoneme alias system is based on multiple publicly available systems. Aliases used for French are derived from Mot, Japanese from IPA and Arpabet, and English from Arpabet with a touch of TGM. The manner that these systems interact for optimal language cross training and accent separation was designed by S'pose who utilized IPA theory to achieve these results.

Allows for use of English data and easy conversion of pre-existing English datas
French, Japanese, and English data can officially be used together for a cross-lingual training and additional language approximation.

Japanese extras are included to support loanwords and language approximation.
